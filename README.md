Routz
=======================

PHP simple routing using the powerful http-foundation component

## License

## Installation

Install it through composer

## Documentation

The api is VERY similar to my previous router, *Routy*.

There is a **very** dirty example file to get the idea behind this router

It's 5am right now and I have to work so I'll document it later.

## Special

I would love to see some pull requests, so many months I didn't touch a single line of code and I would really love to come back doing what I love to do :)
